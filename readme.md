# To train / test a DQN without experience replay, use script_v1.py

# with experience replay, use script_v2.py


# To train / test on different envs, modify the string pass to the initializer of EnvWrapper

# To use a linear network, set 'v1' in the initializer of DeepQN,
           triple-layer DQN, set 'v3'
           Conv-DQN,       set  'v5'
